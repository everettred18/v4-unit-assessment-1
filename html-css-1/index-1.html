            <p>However, for as big of fans as we were, there were certainly those who didn't see Hummer in quite the same light. There were simply too many people that, when they heard the word "Hummer," immediately conjured up images of Arnold Schwarzenegger rolling down PCH with smoke billowing from a fat cigar, along with out of the exhaust stack on his camouflaged Humvee. Unfortunately, when the economy turned during the Great Recession of 2008, GM made the tough decision to shutter the Hummer brand. Now, we're excited to announce the Hummer is making a comeback for the 2022 model year.

                Picking right up where the Hummer brand left off, the all-new 2022 GMC Hummer EV will pack quite a punch when asphalt gives way to dirt. The Hummer's Extreme Off-Road package brings with it 35-inch Goodyear Wrangler All Territory MT tires wrapped on 18-inch wheels (beadlock-capable wheels will be optional in the future). As impressive as 35-inch tires are, the Hummer will arrive able to fit up to a 37-inch tire right from the factory. The Extreme Off-Road package also brings extensive steel underbody armor to protect the battery pack, while off-road and steel rock sliders replace assist steps.

For comparison, both Ford's F-150 Raptor and Ram's TRX have 13 inches of front wheel travel. Air suspension will be standard, as will active dampers, which GMC says are very similar, though upsized, to the suspension found on the 2021 Cadillac Escalade SUV. The air suspension will sport a few unique features, including an Extract mode that will allow the Hummer to raise to its maximum ride height (6 inches above normal, 4 inches above Terrain mode). Extract mode will work to get the Hummer unstuck from large obstacles such as rocks and ledges that it may have gotten hung up on.

                GMC claims that the Hummer will be able to ford water that is more than 2 feet deep. It will have a maximum approach angle of 50 degrees in Extract mode, with a normal approach angle of 44 degrees while in Terrain mode. Departure angle clocks in at 34 degrees. GMC has not announced the physical dimensions of the Hummer (length, width, wheelbase, etc. ), and as such hasn't provided us with a breakover angle, either. What we do know is that it is about the same length as a GMC Sierra 1500, and as wide as a Ford F-150 Raptor (as is denoted by the required clearance lights front and rear). Maximum ground clearance is 16.9 inches in Extract mode, while normal running ground clearance will be better than 10 inches.
